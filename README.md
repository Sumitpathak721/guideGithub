## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform for version control, collaboration, and code sharing. It allows developers to work on projects together, track changes, and manage code efficiently. GitHub is widely used in the software development industry for both open-source and private projects.

## Getting Started

### Creating a GitHub Account

If you don't already have a GitHub account, you can create one for free. Visit [GitHub's Signup Page](https://github.com/join) and follow the instructions.

### Installing Git

Git is a distributed version control system that works seamlessly with GitHub. You can download and install Git by following the instructions for your specific operating system: [Git Installation Guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

### Configuring Git

After installing Git, you'll need to configure it with your GitHub credentials. Run the following commands in your terminal:


```bash
git config --global user.name "Devansh Prakash"
git config --global user.email "devanshprakash02.com"
```

### Choosing a Code Editor

Choose a code editor of your choice so that you can start contributing to Open Source. 
Example of some Code Editors are Microsoft Visual Studio Code, Sublime text, Vim, IntelliJ IDEA etc.
